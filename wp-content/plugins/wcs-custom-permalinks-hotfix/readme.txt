After upgrading to WordPress 3.1.x, many installations suffer broken permalinks for categories and tags. This hotfix repairs the problem.

== Description ==

This plugin is a hotfix for permalink issues encountered with WordPress installations after upgrading to 3.1.x. **It fixes** the 404 error (or blank page) for menu/dropdown categories and tags. **It fixes** pagination for search results, categories, and tags. And, **it fixes** RSS feeds for categories and tags.

Before using it, be sure that your issues are not caused by plugins that modify category links, tag links, and/or canonical redirection ... by deactivating them. More details are available under *Installation* (above) and at Dashboard->WCS-Permalinks (after activation).

== Installation ==

**Plug-in Usage:**

Install and activate the plug-in. No configuration is needed.

**Standard WordPress installation procedure:**

1. Download the ZIP file to your local computer.
1. Unzip the file's contents.
1. Login as an administrator to your WordPress website.
1. Upload the `wcs-custom-permalinks-hotfix` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the WordPress Dashboard->Plugins menu.
1. Visit your home page.
1. Refresh your browser (F5).
1. Verify that the menu/dropdown categories and tags are working.

**Depending on your specific Web browser settings, you may need to:**

1. Clear your browser's cache.
1. Visit your home page.
1. Refresh your browser (F5).
1. And, then test your menus/dropdowns with categories and tags.


**If you're ALSO using a blog cache plug-in, add these steps:**

1. Clear your entire blog cache (with that plug-in's admin panel).
1. Clear your browser's cache.
1. Visit your home page.
1. Refresh your browser twice (F5).
1. Verify that the menu/dropdown categories and tags are working.

**Additional Considerations:**

1. If your WordPress installation resides on a Concentric/XO Communications shared hosting platform, there is an additional issue with permalinks. In this case, visit our [Plug-in Landing Page](http://wpcodesnippets.info/blog/wcs-custom-permalinks-hotfix.html "Plug-in Landing Page") for specific instructions.
